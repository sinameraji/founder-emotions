for the longest time i've wanted to curate a bunch of go-to resources based on my mood, but didn't have the headspace to until now.

this is a next js 15 app (typescript), it lets users login via magiclink to contribute to the pool of moods and resources for each mood. they can also vote.

PRs welcome.

.env file needs just NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY for the app to run
